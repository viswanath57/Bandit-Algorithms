# Bandit Algorithms 

This repo contains code in python that implements several standard algorithms for solving the Multi-Armed Bandits Problem, including:

* epsilon-Greedy
* Softmax (Boltzmann)
* UCB1


It also contains code that provides a testing framework for bandit algorithms based around simple Monte Carlo simulations.
