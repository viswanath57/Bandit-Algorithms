    "#### The Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm\n",
    "- Epsilon Greedy and Softmax does not keep track of how much they know about any of the arms available to them. They pay attention only to _how much reward they have gotten from the arms_. This means that they will under explore options whose initial experiences were not rewarding , even though they do not have enough data to be confident about those arms.\n",
    "- We can do better by using an algorithm that pays attention to not only what it knows, but also how much it knows.\n",
    "- UCB does not use randomness at all. Unlinke epsilon-greedy or softmax, it's possible to know exactly how UCB algorithm will behave in any given situation. This can make it easier to reason about at times.\n",
    "- UCB keep track of our confidence in our assessment of the estimated values of all of the arms.\n",
    "- UCB does not have any free parameters that you need to configure before you can deploy it. This is a major improvement if you were interested in runnning it in the wild, because it means that you can start to use UCB without having a clear sense of what you expect the world to behave like.\n",
    "- _**Taken together, thse use of an explicit measure of confidence, the absense of randomness and the absense of configurable parameter makes UCB very compelling**_"
