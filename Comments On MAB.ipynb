    "- How sure are you that you won't subtly corrupt your deployment code ?\n",
    "- How many different tests are you planning to run simulataneously? Will these tests interfere with each other? Will starting a new test while another one is already running corrupt its results?\n",
    "- How long do you plan to run your tests ?\n",
    "- How many users are you willing to expose to non-perferred versions of your site?\n",
    "- How well-chosen is your metric of success?\n",
    "- How are the arms you were measuting related to one another ?\n",
    "- What additional information about context do you have when choosing arms? Do you have demographics based on browser information? Does your site have access to external information about people's tastes in products you miught advertise to them?\n",
    "- How much traffic does your site receive? Is the system you were building going to scale up? How much traffic can your algorithm handle before it starts to slow your site down?\n",
    "- How much will you have to distort the setup we have introduced when you admit that visitors to real websites are concurrent and are not arriving sequentially as in our simulations?\n",

    "- Even if you have a good metric of success, like the total amount of purchases made by a client ober a period of year, the algorithms described in this book may not work well unless you rescale those metrics into 0-1 space we have used in our examples. Some of the algorithms are numerically ustable, especially the softmax algorithm, which will break down if you start trying to calculate things like exp(10000.0). You need to make sure that you have scaled the rewards in your problem into a range in which algorithms will be numerically stable. If you can try to use the 0-1 scale we have used, which is, as we briefly noted earlier, an absolute requirement if you plan on using the UCB algorithm."

    "##### Running Better Simulations\n",
    "- In addition to initializing your algorithm using prior information you have before deploying a Bandit algorithm, you can often run much better simulations if you use historical information to build appropriate simulations. In this book, we have used a toy Monte Claro simulation with click-through rates that varied from 0.1 to 0.9. Real world click-through rates are typically much lower than this. Because low success rates may mean that your algorithm must run for a very long time before it is able to reach any strong conclusions."

    "##### Moving Worlds\n",
    "- In the real world, the value of different arms in a bandit problem can easily change over time. As we said in the introduction, an orange and black site design might be perfect during session X, but terrible during session Y. Because the true value of an arm might actually shift over time, you want your estimates to be able to do this as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _**Arms with changing values can be a very serious problem if you were not careful when you deploy a bandit algorithm.**_\n",
    "\n",
    "- Epsilon-Greedy, Softmax & UCB1 can not handle most sorts of change in the underlying values of arms well. The problem has to do with the way that we estimate the value of an arm. We typically updated our estimates using the following snippet of the code: _newvalue = (  ( n-1 )  * value + reward )  / float(n)_\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem with this update rule is that 1 / float(n) goes to 0 as n gets large. When you were dealing with millon or billons of palys, this means that recent rewards will have almost zero effect on your estimates of the value of different arms. If those values shifted only a small amount, the algorithm will take a huge number of plays to update its estimated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a simple trick for working around this that can be used if you were careful: instead of estimating the value of arms using strict averages, you can overweight recent events by using a slightly different rule based on a different snippet of code.\n",
    "_newvalue = ( 1-alpha ) * value + alpha * reward_\n",
    "\n",
    "- This alternative updating rule will allow your estimates to shift much more with recent experiences.  When the world can change radically, that flexibility is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unfortunately, the price you pay for the flexibility is the introduction of a new parameter that you will have to tune to your specific business. \n",

When you can make generalizations safely, we say that arms are correlated. To be extremely precise, what matters is that the exptected rewards of different arms are corrleated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To illustrate this idea, let's go back to our earlier idea about experimenting with different color logos. Its reasonable to assume that similar colors are likely to elicit similar reacitons.

You can use any of the techniques available in conventional machine learning for doing this. If those techniques allow you to update your model using online learning, you can build a contextual bandit algorithm out of them.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Domain expertise and good judgement will always be necessary\n",
    "- By testing an algorithm in many different hypothetical worlds, you can build an appreciation for qualitative dynamics that cause a bandit algorithm to succeed in one scneario and to fail in another.\n",
    "- _**Trade-offs, trade-offs, trade-offs**_ : \n",
    "- _**God does play dice**_ : Randomization is the key to the good life.\n",
    "- _**Defaults matter a lot**_  : The way in which you initialize an algorithm can have a powerful effect on its long term success. You need to figure out whether your biases are helping you or hurtung you. No matter what you do, you will be biased in some way or another. What matters is that you spend some time learning whether your biases help or hurt.Part of the genius of UCB family of algorithms is that they make a point to do this initialization in a very systematic way right at the start.\n",
    "- _**Take a chance**_ : You should try everything at the start of your explorations to insure that you know a little bit about the potential value of every option. Do not close your mind without giving a fair shot. At the same time, just one experience should be enough to convince you that some mistakes are not worth repeating.\n",
    "- _**Everybody's gotta grow up sometime**_ You should make sure that you explore less over time.\n",
    "- _**Leave your mistakes behind**_ You should direct your exploration to focus on the second-best option, the third-best option and a few other options that are just a little further away from the best. \n",
    "- _**Do not be cocky**_ : You should keep track of how confident you are about your evaluations of each of the options available to you. Do not be close-minded when you do not have evidence to support your beliefs. A the same time, do not be so unsure of yourself that you forget how much you already know. Measuring one's confidence explicitly is what makes UCB so much more effecitve than either algorithms we studied.\n",
    "- _**Context Matters**_ : You should use any and every piece of information available to you about the context of your experiments. Do not simplify the world too much and pretend you have got things figured out: there's more to optimizing your business that comparing A with B. If you can figure out a way to exploit context using strategies like contextual bandit algorithms, use them. And if there are ways to generalized your experiences across arms, take advantage of them.\n",
